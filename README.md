# sjh. portfolio

Hi, my name is Sheen Joseph Hahn and welcome to my portfolio! Utilizing React, TailwindCSS, and Javascript, this portfolio showcases the frontend development skills I picked up in the last few months at the Georgia Tech Full Stack Development Coding Boot Camp.

Hopefully the portfolio speaks for itself and the content highlights my strengths. The overall design is very minimalist and clean, and while it may not be very colorful or flashy, it does match my personal philosophy of making a clean and polished final product.

My goal was to create an easy-to-read and intuitive layout with a mild yet stylish modern concept that represents a clean canvas. 
## Deployment

Currently, the portfolio is deployed at [on my website](jhahnsheen.com) and the repo can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/jhahnsheen/SJH-Portfolio-v4) as well. However, after the portfolio is finalized, you can expect the portfolio to be deployed to a unique domain. Hope to connect with you!
